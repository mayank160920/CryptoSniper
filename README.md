**Transparent Builds**

Open-sniper is the only bot with full transparency in mind. 

Binaries are built using GitHub Actions and published directly to a release. This happens during the "Release" step of the builds. 

See example here: https://github.com/earteaga88/open-sniper/runs/6201209436?check_suite_focus=true#step:9:1
![release](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93244980/165802350-2dcc0278-fa64-4202-a40c-8597291b0381.png)

**Code Scanning**

Dependabot constantly monitors for out-of-date dependency packages.

Open-Sniper is also scanned with multiple security products using GitHub Actions.
* Snyk
* OSSR
* CodeQL

# Installation

Binaries are available for Linux (x64, arm), macOS (x64, arm), and Windows (x64). Check the [releases page](https://github.com/earteaga88/open-sniper/releases/) for the latest version.

## Linux

Open Terminal.

`curl -L https://github.com/earteaga88/open-sniper/releases/latest/download/open-sniper-linux-x64 -o open-sniper`

`chmod +x open-sniper`

## macOS

Open Terminal.

`curl -L https://github.com/earteaga88/open-sniper/releases/latest/download/open-sniper-macos-x64 -o open-sniper`

`chmod +x open-sniper`

If you try to run `./open-sniper` at this point, you will get a message that macOS has blocked it.

To fix that, go to System Preferences and click Security & Privacy. Click the Open Anyway button in the General pane.

Now you should be able to execute `./open-sniper` in your Terminal.

## Windows

Download the latest Windows release.

https://github.com/earteaga88/open-sniper/releases/latest/download/open-sniper-win-x64.exe

After downloading, you can optionally rename it from "open-sniper-win-64" to open-sniper. It will work either way.

**If you get a message that open-sniper was blocked by SmartScreen/Defender:**

Option 1:
- Click "More Info"
- Click the "Run anyway" button.

Option 2:
- Right click on open-sniper and go to properties
- Check the box that says "unblock" and click OK.

You should now be able to run open-sniper.

**Note:** ~~VirusTotal is giving false positives on the Windows binary. THIS IS A FALSE POSITIVE and known issue with the 'pkg' npm package used to compile the code. See vercel/pkg#1540.~~ It seems VirusTotal is no longer reporting problems with pkg. https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b02a7205040b82b75e7eecf5a84b3aea357288f2138e011f3db797f728e085b6/detection

# Quickstart

### Interactive Mode

Simply running open-sniper by double clicking will start it in interactive mode.

### CLI Mode

In Terminal (Linux/macOS) or CMD prompt (Windows) change your directory to where you downloaded open-sniper.

` cd ~/Downloads`

Configure your wallet by using the CLI or by editing the ~/Documents/open-sniper-cofigs/wallets.json file.

`./open-sniper wallet private_key [paste key]`

Start open-sniper.

`./open-sniper start`

# Settings

A open-sniper-configs folder will be created in your Documents. Inside you will find three JSON files that contain various settings.

* config.json
* nodeConfig.json
* wallets.json

## wallets.json

`private_key`

Enter the private key (64 characters, not the seed phrase) of your wallet that you wish to use open-sniper with. 

`additional_private_keys`

Reserved for future use.

## config.json

The configs.json file is located in the open-sniper-configs folder in your Documents.

`amt_mode`

Use USD, ETH, or TKN to configure the mode of the AMOUNT option. By setting USD will value in U.S. dollars, ETH will value in the native Blockchain token (e.g. ETH, BNB, etc.), and TKN will be in the amount of tokens itself.

When using TKN mode, please make sure you have more than enough native balance to prevent "insufficient funds" error, as open-sniper is unable to estimate the native spending.

`amount`

Enter the amount for each of your transaction.

`slippage`

Enter the BURN (not price movement) tolerance for your transaction.

E.g. If you were supposed to receive 1000 tokens from the swap, and have SLIPPAGE configured at 75, minimally you must receive 250 tokens back, otherwise it will be rejected by the exchange router.

It is highly recommended to keep this configured between 98 and 100.

`mempool_block_delay`

The number of blocks to wait after the addLiquidity transaction is detected.

`iteration`

Enter the number of iteration you wish to perform. Each iteration will weight the AMOUNT parameter. E.g. If you have 0.25 in AMOUNT, and 2 in ITERATION, open-sniper will perform 0.25 ETH x 2, totaling 0.5 ETH.

`gas_price`

This is to configure the gas price of your transactions. You may also use 0 for open-sniper to calculate the gas automatically; 2x of the current network gas.

`priority_gas`

This is to configure the priority gas of your Ethereum Mainnet transactions.

`honeypot_check`

Use true or false to configure if open-sniper should scan the contract address with RugDoc's Honeypot Checker before executing the swap transaction.

`block_severe_fee`

Use true or false to configure if open-sniper should block severely high trading fee (over 50%) tokens. The HONEYPOT_CHECK option must be enabled for this to work.

`delay_execution`

This configures the number of block to skip before executing the swap transaction.

`delay_iteration`

This configures the delay in seconds between each iteration.

`rug_pull_check`

Use true or false to configure if open-sniper should listen to removeLiquidity() related transaction. If such a transaction is detected, open-sniper will TRY to front-run the transaction. 

`sell_management`

Use true or false to configure if open-sniper should monitor the live value and sell options after the swap transactions. 

## nodeConfig.json

This file contains the websocket and RPC node URLs for each blockchain.

## Telegram

The telegram.json file is located in the open-sniper-configs folder in your Documents.

In order for Telegram Scanner and CMC/CG Fastest Alerts Telegram to work, open-sniper needs to log in to your Telegram account.
